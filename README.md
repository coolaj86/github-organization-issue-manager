Github Organization Issue Manager
===

For a small / medium business with relavitely few projects, it's a lot nicer to be able to see a holistic view than to have to drill-down for everything.

  * Completely browser-based
    * Stores all data in localStorage
    * Hosted on Github Pages
    * Uses CORS / XHR2 to communicate directly though the github API.
  * Needs love from a designer
